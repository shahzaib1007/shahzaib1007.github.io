- <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine a world where both water managers and farmers know the precise water needs of crops and apply only the required amount, considering forecasted precipitation. This approach will not only ensure sustainable water use but also reduce excessive groundwater pumping, alleviating water stress. By making informed decisions, both key users of water in the agricultural sector can optimize resource use, promoting long-term sustainability and easing the pressure on water supplies.</p>
