- <p style="text-align: justify;">The scarcity of in-situ observations in many regions underscores the importance of space-based monitoring through satellite missions for tracking geophysical parameters. The fleets of Earth-observing satellites from American, European, and other space agencies, equipped with a range of capabilities across various wavelengths and techniques, represent a powerful yet underutilized resource for the water resources management communityâ€”especially in areas where in-situ data is limited.</p>
